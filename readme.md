## Overview

The objective of Project 3 was to build a fully-functional web application using the MERN stack (React, Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose). I chose to create an application centered around fantasy sports (specifically, fantasy football). The application provides users with a single, centralized location where they can manage their fantasy team rosters and track team/player performance across a multitude of fantasy leagues. 

For the current version (version 1), my goal was to build the core functionality that would enable users to add/edit teams as well as individual player info. Future versions will focus on incorporating external data sources to allow for automatic team/player updates and performance tracking (see "Future Development" below).
